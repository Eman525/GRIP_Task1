# GRIP_Task1
### In this task, I've encountered a problem: pPredicting the percentage of a student based on the number of hours they have studied. Using a sample data set, i have spent time exploring and analyzing the data. Here's a snapshot from that time:
#### 1️. Data visualization: I started by visualize the dataset, ensuring it was ready for the spliting phase for apply the model.
#### 2️. Data Preparation: Using Python, I split the dataset into training and testing sets, a crucial step in evaluating the model's performance. 
#### 3️. Data modling: By taking the power of simple linear regression, I built a powerful model that can predict a student's percentile based on their study hours.
#### 4️. Prediction phase: With the model in place, I put it to the test and successfully predicted the desired results with accuracy and calculate the error.
